LEXER - PARSER

As part of university assignment, I have developed this node project. This project contains a code written a JavaScript file that mimics a compiler.
The language that is being compiled is called SIL - Simple Interpreted Language. 
Just like any other programming language, SIL also has declaration statements, conditional statements like if, nested subroutines and arithmetic expressions.

I have also attached various kinds of input files that you can try to run the code.

At present, error handling is not fully developed in this code.
